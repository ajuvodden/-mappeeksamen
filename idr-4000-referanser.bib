  abstract = {Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over potential confounding variables to reduce alternative explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.}

  abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

Men had significantly ( P {$<$} 0.001) more SM in comparison to women in both absolute terms (33.0 vs. 21.0 kg) and relative to body mass (38.4 vs. 30.6\%). The gender differences were greater in the upper (40\%) than lower (33\%) body ( P {$<$} 0.01). We observed a reduction in relative SM mass starting in the third decade; however, a noticeable decrease in absolute SM mass was not observed until the end of the fifth decade. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in lower body SM. Weight and height explained {$\sim$}50\% of the variance in SM mass in men and women. Although a linear relationship existed between SM and height, the relationship between SM and body weight was curvilinear because the contribution of SM to weight gain decreased with increasing body weight. These findings indicate that men have more SM than women and that these gender differences are greater in the upper body. Independent of gender, aging is associated with a decrease in SM mass that is explained, in large measure, by a decrease in lower body SM occurring after the fifth decade.},

Although compelling evidence has shown that CRF is a strong and independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, the importance of CRF is often overlooked from a clinical perspective compared with other risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or obesity. Several prospective studies indicate that CRF is at least as important as the traditional risk factors, and is often more strongly associated with mortality. In addition, previous studies report that CRF appears to attenuate the increased risk of death associated with obesity. Most individuals can improve their CRF through regular physical activity. Several biological mechanisms suggest that CRF improves insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, body composition, inflammation, and blood pressure. Based on the evidence, health professionals should encourage their patients to improve CRF through regular physical activity.},

Following the post-ET assessment, red blood cell volume (RBCV) reverted to the pre-ET level following phlebotomy and                                              and                                              were determined again.                                                                                                       We speculated that the contribution of skeletal muscle adaptations to an ET-induced increase in                                              could be identified when offsetting the ET-induced increase in RBCV.                                                                                                                              ,                                              , blood volumes, skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume density and capillarization were increased after ET. Following RBCV normalization,                                              and                                              reverted to pre-ET levels.                                                                                                       These results demonstrate the predominant contribution of haematological adaptations to any increase in                                              induced by ET.                                                                                                                 Abstract                                It remains unclear whether improvements in peak oxygen uptake (                                  ) following endurance training (ET) are primarily determined by central and/or peripheral adaptations. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the improvement in                                  following 6~weeks of ET is mainly determined by haematological rather than skeletal muscle adaptations. Sixteen untrained healthy male volunteers (age~=~25~{\textpm}~4~years,                                  ~=~3.5~{\textpm}~0.5~l~min                 -1                 ) underwent supervised ET (6~weeks, 3--4 sessions per week).                                  , peak cardiac output (                                  ), haemoglobin mass (Hb                 mass                 ) and blood volumes were assessed prior to and following ET. Skeletal muscle biopsies were analysed for mitochondrial volume density (Mito                 VD                 ), capillarity, fibre types and respiratory capacity (OXPHOS). After the post-ET assessment, red blood cell volume (RBCV) was re-established at the pre-ET level by phlebotomy and                                  and                                  were measured again. We speculated that the contribution of skeletal muscle adaptations to the ET-induced increase in                                  would be revealed when controlling for haematological adaptations.                                  and                                  were increased (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05) following ET (9~{\textpm}~8 and 7~{\textpm}~6\%, respectively) and decreased (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05) after phlebotomy (-7~{\textpm}~7 and -10~{\textpm}~7\%). RBCV, plasma volume and Hb                 mass                 all increased (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05) after ET (8~{\textpm}~4, 4~{\textpm}~6 and 6~{\textpm}~5\%). As for skeletal muscle adaptations, capillary-to-fibre ratio and total Mito                 VD                 increased (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05) following ET (18~{\textpm}~16 and 43~{\textpm}~30\%), but OXPHOS remained unaltered. Through stepwise multiple regression analysis,                                  , RBCV and Hb                 mass                 were found to be independent predictors of                                  . In conclusion, the improvement in                                  following 6~weeks of ET is primarily attributed to increases in                                  and oxygen-carrying capacity of blood in untrained healthy young subjects.},

One repetition maximum (1RM) was recorded for bench press and leg press at pre-, mid-, and posttest. Subjects trained according to daily undulating periodization (DUP), involving the bench press and leg press exercises between 4RM and 8RM. Training intensity was equated for both groups. Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed statistically significant differences favoring S-3 in the leg press (p {$<$} 0.05, effect size [ES] = 6.5) and differences approaching significance in the bench press (p = 0.07, ES = 2.3). The results demonstrate that for recreationally trained individuals using DUP training, 3 sets of training are superior to 1 set for eliciting maximal strength gains.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 3~weeks with three weekly sessions (ie, nine sessions in total) of short intervals (SI; n~=~9; 3 series with 13~{\texttimes}~30-second work intervals interspersed with 15-second recovery and 3-minutes recovery between series) against effort-matched (rate of perceived effort based) long intervals (LI; n~=~9; 4 series of 5-minute work intervals with 2.5-minutes recovery between series) on performance parameters in elite cyclists (                              73~{\textpm}~4~mL~min               -1               ~kg               -1               ). There were no differences between groups in total volume and intensity distribution of training during the intervention period. SI achieved a larger (               P               ~{$<~$}.05) relative improvement in peak aerobic power output than LI (3.7~{\textpm}~4.3\% vs -0.3~{\textpm}~2.8\%, respectively), fractional utilization of                              at 4~mmol~L               -1               [La               -               ] (3.0~{\textpm}~5.8 percent points vs -3.5~{\textpm}~2.7 percent points, respectively), and larger relative increase in power output at 4~mmol~L               -1               [La               -               ] (2.0~{\textpm}~6.7\% vs -2.8~{\textpm}~3.4, respectively), while there was no group difference in change of                              . Improvements in performance measured as mean power output during 20-minute cycling test were greater (               P               ~{$<~$}.01) in SI compared with LI (4.7~{\textpm}~4.4\% vs -1.4~{\textpm}~2.2\%, respectively). Mean effect size of the improvement in the above variables revealed a small to large effect of SI training vs LI training. The data thus demonstrate that the present SI protocol induces superior training adaptations compared with the present LI protocol in elite cyclists.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of an increasing-distance, interval-training programme and a decreasing-distance, interval-training programme, matched for total distance, on aerobic and anaerobic physiological indices. Forty physical education students were randomly assigned to either the increasing- or decreasing-distance, interval-training group (ITG and DTG), and completed two similar relevant sets of tests before and after six weeks of training. One training programme consisted of increasing-distance interval-training (100--200--300--400--500\>m) and the other decreasing-distance interval training (500--400--300--200--100\>m). While both training programmes led to a significant improvement in VO               2               max (ES = 0.83--1.25), the improvement in the DTG was significantly greater than in the ITG (14.5 {\textpm} 3.6               vs.               7.8 {\textpm} 3.2\%,               p               {$<$} .05). In addition, while both training programmes led to a significant improvement in all anaerobic indices (ES = 0.83--1.63), the improvements in peak power (15.7 {\textpm} 7.8               vs.               8.9 {\textpm} 4.7), mean power (10.6 {\textpm} 5.4               vs.               6.8 {\textpm} 4.4), and fatigue index (18.2 {\textpm} 10.9               vs.               7.0 {\textpm} 14.2) were significantly greater in the DTG compared to the ITG (               p               {$<$} .05). The main finding of the present study was that beyond the significant positive effects of both training programmes on aerobic and anaerobic fitness, the DTG showed significant superiority over the ITG in improving aerobic and anaerobic performance capabilities. Coaches and athletes should therefore be aware that, in spite of identical total work, an interval-training programme might induce different physiological impacts if the order of intervals is not identical.},
